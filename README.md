# Combine Scripts

Ever needed to execute several scripts spread over several folders? Now you can select several files and folders and generate a single combined file to execute or ab/use any way you choose.

## Features

A simple need with a simple solution.

Just use `Ctrl` and `Shift` to select multiple files and folders, then right-click and choose *Combine Scripts*. 

If you select a folder, all SQL files in subfolders will also be included.

The start and end of each script is clearly commented and scripts are separated with `GO` statements.
